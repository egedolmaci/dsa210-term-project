# DSA210 - Term Project Proposal

## Introduction

I have chosen to work on publicly available datasets. They are available on kaggle:

- E-commerce Data
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data/code

- World Development Indicators
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theworldbank/world-development-indicators/code

## Motivation

I was reading about customer behaviours in the modern world in my daily life. Also I know e-commerce is one of most popular locations for custormers today. That is why I have decided to analyze the _E-commerce Data_ dataset. I use the country and product information from this dataset additionally, I use the _World Development Indicators_ dataset to join buying trends with certain economic and societal factors in countries to understand why marketing trends are specifically unique in some certain countries. I am hoping to find insights that are uncommon and has not been paid enough attention.
